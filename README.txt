This is a distributed SFM server/client system primarly for use with VisualSFM and PMVS.

So far usage has been tested in an OS X/Linux environment.  OS X is currently the most tested.  Work is definilty needed to get it up to running on a cloud based system, although this is what it was origianlly set up as (amazon EC2).

To Install, run the INSTALL.sh file, enter your client ip addresses, and go from there.

To Run, cd to a directory full of .jpg images, and sh ServerSFM/lib/server-sfm.sh

Follow the instructions, and.... wait! (less than you did before though!)
